The team must create a UI/UX Design and Style Guidelines Document to standardize the appearance and behavior of all visible UI components.
The document should specify:
Color schemes, typography, spacing, and layout principles.
Component behavior, including hover effects, transitions, and animations.
Accessibility standards, ensuring WCAG compliance where applicable.
Responsive design considerations, defining how components should adapt to different screen sizes.
Teams must reference established UI/UX style guidelines such as:
Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines
Google’s Material Design
IBM’s Carbon Design System
Microsoft Fluent UI
The document should be stored in the GitHub repository and linked in the final submission.
This need not be a lengthy document. The goal is to put everyone on the same page to unify the look and feel across the entire UI and how it supports accessibility. If you are using a CSS framework (e.g., TailwindCSS), then you should include in this document specific styles, themes, or CSS classes that are to be used for specific aspects of the UI.
