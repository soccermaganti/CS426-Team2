# Our Mission

Problem:
Millions of pounds of food go to waste daily while people struggle with food insecurity. Restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals often discard surplus or slightly damaged food instead of donating it.

Solution:
FoodShare is a platform that connects restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals with surplus food to local shelters and food banks.
